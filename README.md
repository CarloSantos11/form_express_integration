# pair_form
This serves as an excercise to go from a vanilla js version of this form 
To a form that leverages the React library. 

     TODO: Paste Link to React version here
     POSSIBLE TODOS For teaching tools: 
      - Form validation: Accept only if correct root directory
      - How can do I link users to an account?
        - Do I need a backend for this?
